            <p class="text-gray-700">During pandemics, most of the parents are not used to simultaneously deal with their home office activities and the monitoring of the home school activities of their children. Therefore, a system allowing a parent, teacher or tutor to assign a task and its corresponding execution time to children, could be helpful in this situation. In this work, a mobile application to assign academic tasks to a child, measure execution time, and monitor the child's attention, is proposed. The children are the users of a mobile application, hosted on a smartphone or tablet device, that displays an assigned task and keeps track of the time consumed by the child to perform this task. Time measurement is performed using face recognition, so it is possible to infer the attention of the child based on the presence or absence of a face. The app also measures the time that the application was in the foreground, as well as the time that the application was sent to the background, to measure boredom. The parent or teacher assigns a task using a desktop application specifically designed for this purpose. At the end of the time set by the user, the application sends to the parent or teacher statistics about the execution time of the task and the degree of attention of the child.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700">There are limited studies regarding the factors of COVID-19 mortality in Indonesia with a more balanced dataset. The previous studies only implemented logistic regression, sensitive to the imbalanced dataset. Meanwhile, other countries implemented survival analysis to overcome the problem. Most survival analyses using Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model require the variables to be time-independent. To this end, this study aims to identify the risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in Indonesia using a survival analysis approach using Jakarta as a case study. We use the Piecewise Exponential Model (PEM) to overcome the time-dependent problem in CPH. The findings show that the COVID-19 mortality does not differ the gender. In contrast, it differs the elderly with 3.5 times higher to be deceased. Dyspnea, malaise, and pneumonia are the primary symptoms associated with COVID-19 mortality. From the comorbidities, diabetes and chronic disease are related to COVID-19, while hypertension and heart attack are still considerable in clustered contexts. The advanced treatment using intubation and extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) produces a relatively large hazard risk of COVID-19 mortality. Based on the findings, we suggest that collaboration among the government, society, and hospitals is vital in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic and minimizing the COVID-19 death.</p>
